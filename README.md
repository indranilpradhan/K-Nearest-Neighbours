# K-Nearest-Neighbours

1. Implement a KNN based classifier to predict digits from images of handwritten
digits in the dataset.
2. Featurize the images as vectors that can be used for classification.
3. Experiment with different values of K(number of neighbors).
4. Experiment with different distance measures - Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance,
5. Report accuracy score, F1-score, Confusion matrix and any other metrics you feel
useful.
6. Implement baselines such as random guessing/majority voting and compare performance. Also, report the performance of scikit-learnâ€™s kNN classifier. Report your
findings.
